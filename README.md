# Javascript Projects
A repository for projects done with studying at The Tech Academy.

I am learning Javascript at The Tech Academy and will be able to display
what I have learned here.  

A few Projects that I would like to highlight:

-[TIC TAC TOE](https://github.com/BURiley22/javascript_projects/tree/main/Basic%20Javascript%20Projects/TicTacToe)
  -_This project created an game of TIC TAC TOE._

***This page will be updated as each project is completed.***
